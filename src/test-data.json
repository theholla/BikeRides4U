We also accept four and five speed internal geared hubs, but nothing larger. No derailleur equipped bicycles unless: a) it is on a Brompton or b) derailleur acts as chain tensioner. This out-and-back ride will be approximately 25 miles long. We'll have a BYO tea stop along the way (coffee OK too), you'll either need to bring a stove, or brew it in advance and carry it in a thermos. We'll have lunch at a pub in Oregon City. This is a LEISURELY ride. We will take our time, we will have breaks. Don't think we'll be done by 1 PM. Nope, this is not that type of ride!
