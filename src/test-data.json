You will be rewarded with nice countryside and beautiful vistas. The ride is a no-drop ride, and won’t be moving fast. (i.e. your leader does not move fast). Expect several regroups. If you like riding hard and fast, this may not be the ride for you, but if you can ratchet back the intensity you may just enjoy yourself!\r\n\r\nRegistration is required, and is free.

We roll out at 2:30. This will be a social-paced mystery ride. We generally make a couple park or supply stops. Each ride is lead by a different CORVIDAE member, and therefore will be unique. NOT A LOOP. This is a safe environment for all. Please check our FB page to review the CORVIDAE Code of Conduct as well as detailed descriptions of each ride. Ca-CAWW!",

You will be rewarded with nice countryside and beautiful vistas. The ride is a no-drop ride, and won’t be moving fast. (i.e. your leader does not move fast). Expect several regroups. If you like riding hard and fast, this may not be the ride for you, but if you can ratchet back the intensity you may just enjoy yourself!\r\n\r\nRegistration is required, and is free.
