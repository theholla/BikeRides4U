        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <h2>Shift’s mission is to promote inclusive bike fun.</h2>
        <p>
          As a loose-knit and informal bunch of bike-loving folks, we ask for no membership, nor dues, only a shared
          passion for the bicycle in all its glory: as toy, as transportation, as a tool for social and environmental
          change!
        </p>
        <p>SHIFT, then, is open to everyone sharing in this passion.</p>
        <p>
          And where would the fun be if we weren’t at least semi-organized?! Yes, SHIFT folks do plan, execute,
          publicize, and get involved in the celebration of bicycle events. We hope you’ll be inspired to join in on the
          bike fun too!
        </p>
        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>
          In August 2002, Portland hosted Bike Summer, a month-long celebration of bicycles and bike culture that drew
          more than 5,000 participants to events including bike-in movies, family rides, bike-repair workshops and more.
          A combination of the overwhelming Community response to the month’s activities and the strong feelings of
          comradery and energy among the primary Bike Summer organizers led to the formation of SHIFT in September 2002.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bike Summer also provided an organizational model for Shift: a central committee creates a communications
          infrastructure for events designed and executed by anyone in the bicycle community. You have an idea for an
          event? Great! We will help you get the word out. For starters, you can submit your bike event to our calendar.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Activities</h2>
        <p>
          SHIFT also facilitates lots of events. Examples of SHIFT-related activities include breakfast give aways,
          social rides, educational bike tours, actions to raise awareness about cyclist injuries or deaths,
          information-sharing events, art-bike parades and more.
